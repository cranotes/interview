## What study are you currently working on
```

Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumor Activity of FN-1501 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced 
Solid Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

Enrollment  :	33 participants

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE:

```
## What is a monitoring plan? 
```
The clinical monitoring plan basically sets out the monitoring strategies and the monitoring 
responsibilities of all parties involved in the clinical trial. 
It also stipulates the frequency of visits, various monitoring methods to be used, 
and the rationale for their use. It also goes further to describe the monitoring procedures, 
types of visits, what is involved in the conduct of those visits, 
and the quantity or percentage of each type of document to be monitored. 
These procedures can be further defined on a protocol basis depending on the purpose, design, size, 
complexity, and primary outcome measures of the trial. 
There is also usually an area of focus in the monitoring plan that goes over protocol compliance, 
SAE reporting, safety, adverse event reporting, quality assurance, and site assessment. 

```

## What is an SAE and what are the 6 criteria that determine an SAE?
```
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that could lead to any of the following:

Hospitalization or prolong an existing hospitalization
Death
Birth Defect /Congenital Anomaly
Disability
Life threatening 
Anything that PI feels is life threatening. 

```
## If a subject does not sign ICF what will you do? 
```
I will ask the site to immediately contact the subject and have the subject come in to be re-consented. 
At that time, the subject will have to sign and date the ICF. 
All study procedures should be put on hold until the subject has signed the ICF. 
```
## What is the monitor’s involvement in subject enrollment? 
```
The monitor helps the site whenever they are not enrolling enough patients for the study. 
They can help by providing advice on ways to recruit like advertisement methods, 
or subject reach out to subjects in the sites database that have the indication or had a past history of the indication. 
Once a subject is enrolled, the monitor is to go out to the site 
and review the data of the subject to ensure they are actually eligible for the study. 
```
## What is FDA 1571: 
```
The 1571 is the Investigational New Drug Application. 
It provides the structure to present the information about the proposed research.
```
## What is FDA 1572? 
```
The 1572 is the statement of investigator form, 
it is an agreement signed by the investigator to provide certain information to the sponsor 
and assure that he/she will comply with FDA regulations related to 
the conduct of the clinical investigation of an investigation drug or biologic. 
```
## What is a FDA 483? 
```
483s are usually issued whenever there is an FDA inspection at a site and there are major findings. 
If major findings are found during the audit inspection, the FDA will issue a 483. 
```
## What is FDA 3674: 
```
This form certifies that the study is registered in the national database of clinical trials
```

## Name 10 essential documents found in the Investigator Site File (ISF)
```
-Investigator’s Brochure (IB) – outlines scientific information about the investigational product.
-Study protocol – this includes the current protocol as well as any amendments and historical protocols.
-Informed consent documentation – any information given to the trial subject (patient). 
 This includes the consent form itself in addition to any other written 
 pieces of information provided to support the consent and, if relevant, advertisements for recruitments used.
-Financial Disclosure agreements
-Insurance statements
-Confidential Disclosure Agreement
-1572
-Signed agreements between involved parties – any agreement an investigator has with a sponsor, CRO and other authorities.

-Normal values and/or ranges of the tests
-Instructions for investigational product and other trial-related materials handling
-Shipping records for trial-related materials
-Decoding procedures for blinded trials
-Pre-trial monitoring report – documents that the site is suitable for the trial and that procedures have been reviewed with trial staff.
```

## How do you review a DOA log?
```
Looking through it to make sure it provides a comprehensive list of study staff members 
and the duties that have been delegated to them by the Principal Investigator.

-Staff Name and Credentials, if applicable: 
-Study Role
-Study Specific Tasks
-Staff Signature and Initials
-Start Date of Responsibilities 
-End Date of Responsibilities
```

## What are common errors you come across when reviewing an Informed consent form
```
An unapproved/expired version of the consent form was used.

The full consent form was not used (i.e., consent form is missing pages)

Information in the consent was crossed out or altered in any way not approved by the IRB

The person who obtained consent was not approved to do so per IRB-approved protocol

All required signatures were not obtained3 (i.e., participant, person obtaining consent, parent, second parent if required, LAR, witness)

Not all sections of the consent form were completed (i.e., check boxes unchecked, initials/signatures missing for optional procedures)

Participant’s printed name missing on the form
```

## Describe how you determine that the PI is managing the study properly 
```
You determine the PI is managing the study properly when he/she leads the conduct 
of a clinical trial at a study site in compliance with GCP guidelines, 
provides assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected, 
and that the results of the clinical trials are credible and accurate. 

```
## What is ALCOA. Describe with examples
```
Its a data integrity standard that ensures that data you are entering is correct and accurate and you will be able to tell who entered the data.

Attributable - It should be obvious who documented or did what; traceable to a person, date, and subject visit.

Legible - The Record should be easy to read and signatures identifiable

Contemporaneous - The information should be documented as it happens

Original - First record of the information or certified copy. The investigator should have the original source document.

Accurate - Accurate, consistent and real representation of facts.

Complete - The information should be complete (i.e., to answer who, what, when, where, why, and how).
```
## How do you perform SDV?
```
By doing a quality control check to ensure that source data 
corresponds to entries in the EDC or case report form.
```
## What is SDR? Describe SDR?
```
SDR means Source Data Review 
It is the review of the source documentation to check on quality, protocol and GCP compliance
```

## How do you perform IP accountability
```
Drug accountability includes study drugs Storage, handling, dispensing and 
documentation of administration, return and/or destruction of the drugs.

It  is  good  practice  to  update  the  device  accountability  log  with relevant  information  immediately.   

-Number of IP recieved from the sponsor.
-Date when the IP is received.
-Date when the IP is assigned to the subject.
-How many pills were assigned to each subject.
-Date of return of the IP.
-How many pills/units of IP were returned
-Ip thats returned to the sponsor/CRO at the end of the study and date.

## What is an IRB?
```
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an independent body established 
to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants.

The purpose of an IRB is to safeguard the rights, 
safety, and well–being of all human research participants. 
```
## Describe the types of IRB and Advantage of each?

**Local IRBs** 

Are affiliated with an institution, such as a hospital, university,
medical center, or group of care facilities; thus, local IRBs are
geographically close to and knowledgeable about the institutions,
investigators, and community of potential subjects participating in
the research. In most cases, an investigator who is affiliated with
a specific institution must apply for approval from the local IRB
associated with that same institution.

**Independent IRBs**

Not all institutions have IRBs; instead, some may arrange for an
“outside” IRB to review research. These outside IRBs, which are not
associated with any specific institution, are referred to as independent
IRBs, central IRBs, or national IRBs.
