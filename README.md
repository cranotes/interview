Conducting visit, Pssv, imv and closing out the site. 

Currently have in the average 3 studies across 14 to 16 sites.

## What study are you currently working on
```
A Phase 1, interventional, Multi-center, Open-label, Single-arm, Dose-escalation, Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumor Activity of FN-1501 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced 
Solid Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

Enrollment  :	33 participants

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE:
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 


SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) [ Time Frame: During the first year. ]
Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) [ Time Frame: During the first year. ]
Area under concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)

INCLUSION CRITERIA
Male and female 18 years old and above
Able to understand and sign informed consent form
Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors who have relapsed or refractory disease or relapsed/refractory AML
Expected to survive at least 2 to 3 month:


EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Participation in another therapeutic clinical trial within 3 weeks of enrollment.
Having received a major surgical operation within 4 weeks of enrollment.
Active known infection, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus.
Serious kidney injury, requiring dialysis
Serious liver injury, and advanced liver diseases of Child-Pugh class B and C
```
## What is a monitoring plan? 
```
The clinical monitoring plan basically sets out the monitoring strategies and the monitoring 
responsibilities of all parties involved in the clinical trial. 
It also stipulates the frequency of visits, various monitoring methods to be used, 
and the rationale for their use. It also goes further to describe the monitoring procedures, 
types of visits, what is involved in the conduct of those visits, 
and the quantity or percentage of each type of document to be monitored. 
These procedures can be further defined on a protocol basis depending on the purpose, design, size, 
complexity, and primary outcome measures of the trial. 
There is also usually an area of focus in the monitoring plan that goes over protocol compliance, 
SAE reporting, safety, adverse event reporting, quality assurance, and site assessment.
