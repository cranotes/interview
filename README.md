# Interview

## Tell me what you are doing right now?
```
Right now i'm a site monitor. I'm responsible for my assigned site in respect to site managment. 

Conducting visit, Pssv, imv and closing out the site. 

Currently have in the average 3 studies across 14 to 16 sites.

```

## What study are you currently working on
```
A Phase 1, interventional, Multi-center, Open-label, Single-arm, Dose-escalation, Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumor Activity of FN-1501 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced 
Solid Tumors or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

Enrollment  :	33 participants

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE:
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 


SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) [ Time Frame: During the first year. ]
Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) [ Time Frame: During the first year. ]
Area under concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)

INCLUSION CRITERIA
Male and female 18 years old and above
Able to understand and sign informed consent form
Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors who have relapsed or refractory disease or relapsed/refractory AML
Expected to survive at least 2 to 3 month:


EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Participation in another therapeutic clinical trial within 3 weeks of enrollment.
Having received a major surgical operation within 4 weeks of enrollment.
Active known infection, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus.
Serious kidney injury, requiring dialysis
Serious liver injury, and advanced liver diseases of Child-Pugh class B and C
```
## What is a monitoring plan? 
```
The clinical monitoring plan basically sets out the monitoring strategies and the monitoring 
responsibilities of all parties involved in the clinical trial. 
It also stipulates the frequency of visits, various monitoring methods to be used, 
and the rationale for their use. It also goes further to describe the monitoring procedures, 
types of visits, what is involved in the conduct of those visits, 
and the quantity or percentage of each type of document to be monitored. 
These procedures can be further defined on a protocol basis depending on the purpose, design, size, 
complexity, and primary outcome measures of the trial. 
There is also usually an area of focus in the monitoring plan that goes over protocol compliance, 
SAE reporting, safety, adverse event reporting, quality assurance, and site assessment. 

```

## What is an SAE and what are the 6 criteria that determine an SAE?
```
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that could lead to any of the following:

Hospitalization or prolong an existing hospitalization
Death
Birth Defect /Congenital Anomaly
Disability
Life threatening 
Anything that PI feels is life threatening. 

```
## If a subject does not sign ICF what will you do? 
```
I will ask the site to immediately contact the subject and have the subject come in to be re-consented. 
At that time, the subject will have to sign and date the ICF. 
All study procedures should be put on hold until the subject has signed the ICF. 
```
## What is the monitor’s involvement in subject enrollment? 
```
The monitor helps the site whenever they are not enrolling enough patients for the study. 
They can help by providing advice on ways to recruit like advertisement methods, 
or subject reach out to subjects in the sites database that have the indication or had a past history of the indication. 
Once a subject is enrolled, the monitor is to go out to the site 
and review the data of the subject to ensure they are actually eligible for the study. 
```
## What is FDA 1571: 
```
The 1571 is the Investigational New Drug Application. 
It provides the structure to present the information about the proposed research.
```
## What is FDA 1572? 
```
The 1572 is the statement of investigator form, 
it is an agreement signed by the investigator to provide certain information to the sponsor 
and assure that he/she will comply with FDA regulations related to 
the conduct of the clinical investigation of an investigation drug or biologic. 
```
## What is a FDA 483? 
```
483s are usually issued whenever there is an FDA inspection at a site and there are major findings. 
If major findings are found during the audit inspection, the FDA will issue a 483. 
```
## What is FDA 3674: 
```
This form certifies that the study is registered in the national database of clinical trials
```

 This includes the consent form itself in addition to any other written 
 pieces of information provided to support the consent and, if relevant, advertisements for recruitments used.
