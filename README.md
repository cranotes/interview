   <summary>What type of training did you take to become a CRA?,  What is the main role of a CRA? Tell me something you are most proud of in your career to date? What is your process for trip report submissions? </summary>
   
### What type of training did you take to become a CRA? 

CRA bridge program / Ace program or PACE program.

### What is the main role of a CRA? 

The main function of a clinical research associate is to monitor clinical trials and assure the protection of the rights, safety, and wellbeing of human study subjects. CRAs also ensure that accurate data is generated from the trial?  How do you get your reports in on time? Have you ever attended an IM(Investigator meeting) or presented?  .

### Tell me something you are most proud of in your career to date? 

ANS 1: I am most proud of the fact that I have a 100% compliance rate when it comes to trip report writing. I have never submitted a late trip report. 
ANS 2: I am most proud of the relationships I have built with my sites throughout my career as a CRA. I have a great relationship with several of my sites. 

### What sites do you work with? Some of my sites are as follows;

MD Anderson, Dana Farber, Sarah Cannon, UCLA, University of Birmingham, Mayo Clinic, University of Colorado, Emory University, Piedmont Hospital, University of Wisconsin, John Hopkins University, UT Southwestern, Rutgers, Memorial Sloan Kettering Center, Vanderbilt University.

### What is your process for trip report submissions? 

The draft is due in 5 business days and the final is due in 5 business days. 
So we have a total of 10 business days for finalization to approval.

### How do you get your reports in on time? 

I always start my report while I am on site. I do that because the information is still fresh in my head. With that I usually have about 50% of the report done on site. I finish up the report once I leave the site in my hotel room or on the plane ride back home. With this habit, I usually have my draft in by the 2nd or 3rd business day. 

### Have you ever attended an IM(Investigator meeting) or presented? 
   
```   

I have attended several IMs but I have never presented at an IM before. 

Am IM is nothing but a group meeting conducted on behalf of sponsor/CROs 
   
to train investigators and their lead clinical trial staff on trial related activities, 
   
standard operating procedures and to discuss the applicable regulatory picture.

<summary>What is a monitoring plan? </summary>
   
```
   
The clinical monitoring plan basically sets out the monitoring strategies and the monitoring 
responsibilities of all parties involved in the clinical trial. 
It also stipulates the frequency of visits, various monitoring methods to be used, 
and the rationale for their use. It also goes further to describe the monitoring procedures, 
types of visits, what is involved in the conduct of those visits, 
and the quantity or percentage of each type of document to be monitored. 
These procedures can be further defined on a protocol basis depending on the purpose, design, size, 
complexity, and primary outcome measures of the trial. 
There is also usually an area of focus in the monitoring plan that goes over protocol compliance, 
SAE reporting, safety, adverse event reporting, quality assurance, and site assessment.

At that time, the subject will have to sign and date the ICF. 
All study procedures should be put on hold until the subject has signed the ICF.
   

</details>

<details>
   <summary>What are common errors you come across when reviewing an Informed consent form</summary>
   
An unapproved/expired version of the consent form was used.

The full consent form was not used (i.e., consent form is missing pages)

Information in the consent was crossed out or altered in any way not approved by the IRB

The person who obtained consent was not approved to do so per IRB-approved protocol

All required signatures were not obtained3 (i.e., participant, person obtaining consent, parent, second parent if required, LAR, witness)

Not all sections of the consent form were completed (i.e., check boxes unchecked, initials/signatures missing for optional procedures)

Participant’s printed name missing on the form
   

</details>

<details>
   <summary>What is the monitor’s involvement in subject enrollment?</summary>
   
The monitor helps the site whenever they are not enrolling enough patients for the study. 
They can help by providing advice on ways to recruit like advertisement methods, 
or subject reach out to subjects in the sites database that have the indication or had a past history of the indication. 
Once a subject is enrolled, the monitor is to go out to the site 
and review the data of the subject to ensure they are actually eligible for the study.

   <summary>What is an IRB and the types of IRB?</summary>
   
## What is an IRB?
```
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an independent body established 
to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants.

The purpose of an IRB is to safeguard the rights, 
safety, and well–being of all human research participants. 
```
## Describe the types of IRB and Advantage of each?

**Local IRBs** 

Are affiliated with an institution, such as a hospital, university,
medical center, or group of care facilities; thus, local IRBs are
geographically close to and knowledgeable about the institutions,
investigators, and community of potential subjects participating in
the research. In most cases, an investigator who is affiliated with
a specific institution must apply for approval from the local IRB
associated with that same institution.

**Independent IRBs**

Not all institutions have IRBs; instead, some may arrange for an
“outside” IRB to review research. These outside IRBs, which are not
associated with any specific institution, are referred to as independent
IRBs, central IRBs, or national IRBs.

## What is RECIST and what version do you use?

**Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST)** is a set of published rules that 
define when tumors in cancer patients **improve ("respond"), 
stay the same ("stabilize"), 
or worsen ("progress")** during treatment.

![RECIST](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99203797/153050225-a2775928-9086-4161-9270-3e296e3e3405.png)

## What is ECOG?

The ECOG(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group )

It describes a **patient's level of functioning** in terms of their ability to care for themself, 

daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.).

## What is KPS?

 Also called **Karnofsky Performance Status**
 
**A standard way of measuring the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks.** 

KPS may be used to determine a patient's prognosis, 
to measure changes in a patient's ability to function, 
or to decide if a patient could be included in a clinical trial


## What is staging 
```
The stage of a cancer describes the size of a tumour 
and how far it has spread from where it originated.
```
## What is grading
```
The grade describes the appearance of the cancerous cells.
